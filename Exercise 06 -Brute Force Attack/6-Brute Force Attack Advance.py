## Exercise 6: Brute Force Attack - 30 Marks

#Defining the correct password
password = 12345
#Maximum number of attempts
max_attempts = 5
attempts = 0
#Using while loop to control the attempts
while attempts < max_attempts:
    b = int(input("Enter your password:"))
    attempts += 1
    if b == password:
        print("The password you entered is correct.")
        break
    else:
        remaining_attempts = max_attempts - attempts
        if remaining_attempts > 0:
            print(f"Incorrect password. You have {remaining_attempts} attempts left.")
        else:
            print("You entered too many incorrect passwords!")
